abstract: "Understanding the neural basis of cognitive control is a central issue in cognitive neuroscience, given its core importance for the flexibility that characterizes human behaviour. This review integrates the main findings in the field, underscoring the role of fronto-parietal regions in both proactive (representing tasks in anticipation to prepare the system for action) and reactive (detecting and resolving conflicts in processing) control. In addition, we review the dynamics of interaction between these areas and other brain  regions in the range of slow frequencies. Finally, we highlight central questions in the field that have yet to be answered."
